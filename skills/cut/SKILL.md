description: Attack the hidden assumptions that could make the current plan look stupid in hindsight. Use before committing effort to a direction. Returns the load-bearing assumptions, how each breaks, the signal that would reveal the break, and the cheapest test to falsify it — then the top three kill-tests to run now.

# /ratchet:cut — the anti-delusion pass

Every plan rests on assumptions. Most are fine. A few are load-bearing and wrong, and
those are the ones that waste days. This command finds them and hands you the cheapest
test to kill each before it costs you.

## Step 0 — Load state

```
ratchet status
```

## Procedure

1. **Surface the assumptions** the current objective and chosen bottleneck depend on.
   Include the silent ones — "the API returns what the docs say", "the user actually
   wants this", "this file is the source of truth", "the test suite covers this path".

2. For each assumption, specify:
   - **Breakage mode** — what specifically goes wrong if it is false.
   - **Detection signal** — the observable that would reveal the break.
   - **Falsification test** — the cheapest action that would prove it false. Prefer a
     five-minute check over a five-hour build.

3. **Rank by damage × likelihood.** An assumption that is cheap to test and catastrophic
   if wrong goes first.

4. **Pick the top three kill-tests** — the ones worth running before any further build.
   A kill-test is a test designed to *end* the plan cheaply, not to confirm it.

## Output contract

```
ASSUMPTIONS (ranked by damage × likelihood):
- <assumption> | breaks: <mode> | signal: <detection> | test: <cheapest falsification>
- ...

TOP 3 KILL-TESTS (run before building):
1. <test> — kills the plan if: <result>
2. ...
3. ...
```

## Serialize

Record the riskiest untested assumptions so the loop can't forget them:

```
ratchet state append assumptions '{"text":"...","killTest":"...","status":"untested"}'
ratchet state set phase cut
```

Untested assumptions drain confidence (`ratchet score confidence`). Run the kill-tests,
then mark survivors: append with `"status":"tested"` or `"status":"killed"`.

Next: if the plan survives, `/ratchet:build`. If a kill-test lands, `/ratchet:lock` again.
