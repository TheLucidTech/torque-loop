name: attack
description: Run adversarial review on a finished-looking artifact. Use to replace self-praise with hostile pressure before shipping. Convenes a five-voice review board (impatient user, competitor, maintainer, auditor, saboteur), returns concrete failure modes with severity and evidence demanded, and the smallest patch each requires.

# /ratchet:attack — hostile validation

Self-review is theater. The model that built the artifact is the worst judge of it. This
command assumes the artifact is wrong and spends its effort proving where.

## Step 0 — Load state and target

```
ratchet status
```

Identify the artifact under attack (usually the last one in state). For anything that
looks finished, delegate the assault to the `ratchet-auditor` subagent.

## The five-voice board

Speak in each voice distinctly. Do not blur them into generic "concerns".

1. **Impatient User** — slower, harder, or more confusing than the alternative.
2. **Competitor** — where a rival beats this and takes the user.
3. **Maintainer** — how this rots or becomes unchangeable in six months.
4. **Auditor** — which claims are asserted without evidence.
5. **Saboteur** — the specific input or state that makes it fall over.

## Rules

- **Every objection is a concrete failure scenario:** specific input/state → wrong output
  or crash. "Might be fragile" is not a finding; "empty input throws at step 3" is.
- **Rank by severity:** critical / high / medium / low. Critical = wrong result, data
  loss, or unusable. Order most-severe first.
- **Demand evidence** for every self-serving claim ("robust", "fast", "complete"). Find
  the contradicting case or mark the claim unproven.
- **Name the smallest patch** each finding needs — REMOVE / ADD / CHANGE. You specify the
  delta; you do not apply it here.

## Output contract

```
VERDICT: ship | patch-then-ship | do-not-ship
FINDINGS (most severe first):
- [CRITICAL] <voice> — <failure scenario> → <REMOVE/ADD/CHANGE ...>
- [HIGH] ...
UNPROVEN CLAIMS:
- "<quote>" — evidence demanded: ...
```

## Serialize

Record every real defect (one call each) so confidence reflects reality:

```
ratchet defect add '{"severity":"critical","summary":"..."}'
ratchet state set phase attack
```

If nothing critical or high survived a genuine attack, say so plainly — that is a real
result. Next: `/ratchet:patch` to fix exactly what failed.
