Convenes a five-voice review board (impatient user, competitor, maintainer, auditor, saboteur), returns concrete failure modes with severity and evidence demanded, and the smallest patch each requires.';

Use when there are many possible next moves and you risk doing interesting-but-not-advancing work. Scores obstacles by Leverage × Certainty × Speed-to-unblock × Risk-of-ignoring and names the winner and why it beats the tempting alternative.';

Produces the smallest usable v0 (spec, prompt, checklist, test-suite, decision-record, code-patch, qa-ledger, or operating-procedure) with explicit holes and a 5-point working test.';

  SET s.command = '/ratchet:burn', s.description = 'Kill or park the options that are quietly draining energy. Use when you are carrying option debt — too many open possibilities, none advancing.

Use at the end of a work session or after any real advance. Returns working title, objective, decisions, artifacts, defects/risks, open loops, next action, next command, retrieval tags, and a one-sentence memory. Only keeps information that changes future behavior.';

Not brainstorming and not a general \'make this better\': every kept change must be proven. Use to harden a specific code file, prompt, skill, test suite, README, spec, or workflow along a chosen pressure vector.';

Returns a self-contained brief — objective, what\'s done, what\'s decided, what\'s open, the exact next action, and the context needed to act — compressed so the receiver can start immediately with zero re-derivation.';

Use when uncertainty is high (aperture A3–A4), the terrain is unfamiliar, the taste is "I\'ll know it when I see it", or you are porting a reference implementation. Walks the task through four unknown-quadrants — known knowns (settled ground with file evidence), known unknowns (one blast-radius-ordered question at a time), unknown knowns (tacit taste surfaced by putting something concrete in front of the user), and unknown unknowns (a swept landmine field) — then hands over one durable four-quadrant map, a tweakable build plan, and a copy-paste implementation prompt. What you deliver is the map, not a build; you do not write code until it is handed over.';
MERGE (s:RatchetSkill {ns: 'torque-loop', name: 'mechanism'})
  SET s.command = '/ratchet:mechanism', s.description = 'Name the mechanism when a situation feels confusing. Use to cut through a tangle to the one causal handle. Separates surface symptoms from the underlying mechanism, the constraint causing it, the feedback loop keeping it alive, and the highest-leverage intervention point — then the action that changes the mechanism rather than describing it.';
MERGE (s:RatchetSkill {ns: 'torque-loop', name: 'patch'})
  SET s.command = '/ratchet:patch', s.description = 'Fix only what failed — nothing else. Use after an attack surfaced defects, to prevent the model from rewriting everything for elegance.

Use to find what a prompt collection over-does, under-does, and where it leaks into meta-looping. Classifies each prompt by the work it performs, finds overrepresented and missing moves, flags prompts that cause meta-loops or never produce artifacts, and returns the minimum upgraded set as a sequenced workflow.';

  SET s.command = '/ratchet:push', s.description = 'Push the boundary after a safe version already exists. Use to find the boldest adjacent move that could multiply the result without turning it into fantasy. Returns the safe default, the boundary-pushing path, why it might work, why it might be stupid, the cheapest experiment that distinguishes them, the version to try, and the first irreversible move. Controlled aggression, never recklessness.';

Builds acceptance / happy-path / edge / abuse / ambiguity / regression tests plus fake-progress red flags, runs the artifact through them, and returns passes, failures, severity, required patches, and whether it is usable despite failures.';
